Getting Started
===============

txOAuth is a package for writing OAuth 2.0 enabled applications in Python
using Twisted.

Prerequisites
-------------

txOAuth requires a recent version of Twisted to run.

txOAuth uses Twisted Cred and adapters extensively, and you probably won't
understand much without understanding those two concepts. You should probably
start by reading the `Twisted Cred howto`_ and the `components introduction`_
if you're not yet familiar with those concepts.
